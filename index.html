        I offer text digitization services using advanced OCR and HWR
        technologies, specializing in extracting information from handwritten
        records and PDFs. My expertise includes developing Python-based tools
        and web applications for data extraction. My primary focus is supporting
        heritage and community projects by providing seamless digitization
        solutions.

        Whether it's fieldwork notes or historic grave record documents, I
        ensure accurate text extraction and data compilation into user-friendly
        formats such as CSV. With experience in frontend and backend
        development, I create web applications with intuitive interfaces,
        allowing for uploads directly from the field and real-time data
        processing.
